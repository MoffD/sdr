Simple Dice Roller
=======

Dice rolling program designed to be small and easy to use as an example program and in tabletop games if allowed.

##Compiling
Uses clang and make, although any c compiler should work. 
There is no automatic installation with `make install` currently.

##Usage
Does not take any command line arguments. After running, type the number of dice, the letter d and then the number of sides for the dice. Ex: `1d20` would roll a single 20 sided die. Multiple dice rolls can also be linked together, as in: `1d20 6d8`
